# QueueMonitor
Example MVC5/JQuery Queue Monitoring Page

A few things in the example site code:

T4 Templates for generating IContext, CrudRepositories, and Entities against EF6 

QueryObjects - use of these instead of going down the Repository route

Mediator pattern - inject a Mediator into the controller which in turn understands how to process a QueryObject

JQuery - post data, and manipulate response data, exception handling etc. Custom Sorting and Paging

MVC5 - Filters, routes, Custom Server side sorting and paging

Bootstrap - design for various browser sizes
